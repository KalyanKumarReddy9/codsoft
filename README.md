## 📂 Project Overview

### 1. 📩 SMS Spam Detection

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that classifies SMS messages as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using traditional preprocessing techniques.

#### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `nltk` for text preprocessing (stopwords, tokenization, stemming)
- `string` for punctuation handling

#### 📋 Key Features:
- Text preprocessing with NLTK
- Stopword removal, stemming (SnowballStemmer)
- Tokenization and normalization
- Ready for model training using Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression

### 2. ✍️ Handwritten Digit Generation

This project uses a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** approach with **LSTM layers** to generate or model sequences similar to handwritten digits. A creative use of LSTM rather than standard GANs or CNNs.

#### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
- `TensorFlow` and `Keras` for deep learning
- `Sequential`, `LSTM`, `Dense`, and `Activation` layers for model architecture
- `NumPy` for numerical computations

#### 📋 Key Features:
- LSTM-based digit generation
- Uses synthetic or MNIST-like structured input
- Fully trainable architecture

### 3. 🎬 Movie Genre Prediction

A data scraping and classification task where movie genres are predicted using features collected from the web.

#### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries:
- `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping
- `requests` for accessing HTML pages
- `os` for file handling and dataset management

#### 📋 Key Features:
- Scrapes movie titles and metadata
- Prepares a dataset from online sources
- Predicts genres using the collected features
